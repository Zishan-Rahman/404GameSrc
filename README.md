# The 404 Game

I decided to release the source code of this game (both the game code and the HTML5 export code) to the public, first of all so that I could use the HTML5 export repository as a submodule (since GitHub pages does not process private repo submodules), and secondly because I saw this game as too mundane for me to fuss over its source code. Hope *you* have fun with it, at least!
